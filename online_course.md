# Course Syllabus


#### Schedule

*WEEK 1* Getting Started & Learning about New Problems
We'll configure our computers, make our first charts, understand why data joins are helpful, and get a sense of all the things we need to learn.

 * Introduction, configuring machines, intro to data visualization
 * Making our first chart – a scatter plot
 * Charting and intent
 * Bar charts
 * The fiddly bits: axes, formatting, etc.

*WEEK 2* Enough to be Dangerous: Mastering Basic Forms
If you want to be good at data viz, you need to master bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and histograms. We'll make demos of each and learn when to use which.

 * Line + area charts
 * Histograms
 * Tables to line + area charts

*WEEK 3* Data Sketching & Traversing Data Structures
 Since your computer is drawing the charts instead of you, making 100 charts is as manageable as making 1. We'll explore the power of exploratory sketching and the data manipulation you'll need to know in order to use it.

 * Making things move
 * Sketching in the browser and making applications that scale

*WEEK 4* Maps
Mapping with D3 has exploded in the last few years. We'll learn how to make bubble maps, choropleth maps, and will create topojson files from scratch.

*WEEK 5* Making Dynamic Content
We'll use D3 to make dynamic charts and applications that let us answer questions and solve problems that wouldn’t be possible in a printed format.

* Data visualization on mobile devices
* D3 and Node

*WEEK 6* Editing & Publishing an Idea
In our last week, we’ll focus on honing ideas and making publication-grade data visualizations. We'll work on small touches, like custom annotations and styles, managing your data visualizations on mobile devices, incorporating feedback, and pitching work for publication. We'll also do a "show and tell" of projects we've been working on throughout the 6 weeks.

## Prerequisites 

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

++A if you have experience with Web Dev, Design, Data Analysis and Github

## Why Learn D3?

**from D3.js...**

D3 is not a monolithic framework that seeks to provide every conceivable feature. Instead, D3 solves the crux of the problem: efficient manipulation of documents based on data. This avoids proprietary representation and affords extraordinary flexibility, exposing the full capabilities of web standards such as HTML, SVG, and CSS. With minimal overhead, D3 is extremely fast, supporting large datasets and dynamic behaviors for interaction and animation. D3’s functional style allows code reuse through a diverse collection of components and plugins.
